# To setup local credentials (options- local, global, without)

"""
in summary, the --global flag is used to set configurations that apply globally across all Git repositories on your machine. Without the --global flag, configurations are set at the local repository level and are specific to that repository. It's common to use global configurations for user information that is consistent across all your Git projects (e.g., your personal name and email address), while local configurations can be used for project-specific settings.git config and git config --local are esentially the same.
